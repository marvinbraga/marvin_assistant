## Description

This project is an interactive voice assistant that allows users to interact through voice commands. The software
captures the user's speech, converts it into text, sends it to the OpenAI API for processing, and then converts the
response back into speech.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End:** Pygame
- **Back-End:** FastAPI
- **Data Storage:** Redis
- **Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Specific libraries (e.g., Whisper for transcription and gTTS for
  speech synthesis)
- **Integration with OpenAI API**

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Poetry (Python package manager)

### Installation

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone [Repository URL]
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```shell
   poetry install
   ```

### Docker Compose Back-end Execution

To run the back-end, with `Docker Compose` use the following command in the terminal:

```shell
inv rebuild
```

### Execution

To run the application, use the following command in the terminal:

```shell
cd frontend
```

```shell
python main.py
```

## Instructions

After starting the application, click and hold the right mouse button to start recording the command. To end the
command, simply release the right mouse button. You will hear a beep when the recording process starts and also when it
ends. Once the `mp3` file of the command is generated, it will be converted into text and sent to the `Chat API`. This
communicates with the `LLM API`, which is responsible for generating a response. In the end, an audio response is
generated by the external `ElevenLabs API` and this audio is played.

## Features

- **Audio Capture:** Start audio recording by clicking a button in the user interface.
- **Audio-to-Text Transcription:** The captured audio is converted into text.
- **Interaction with the OpenAI API:** The text is sent to the OpenAI API and processed.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** The generated response is converted into speech.
- **Chat Interface:** Display of back-and-forth messages as a chat.
